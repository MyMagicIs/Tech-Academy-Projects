The world of gods and men is built upon roots deep and strong, intertwined with fate, blood, and destiny..

Yggdrasil, the great tree, holds all in its massive branchesâ€”the Nine Realms, home to gods, giants, dwarves, men, and the forces of chaos.

The tree has witnessed the rise of heroes and villains alike, but none more mysterious than Gnut, the silent champion born from the earth, a protector hidden from time itself.
